                <p>All of my life I have loved art. Art museums, plays, musicals, dance, art festivals, paintings and sculpture; art is the freedom to express your thoughts and feelings. Most of my art is vibrant and happy, which I guess makes it an extension of who I am. Making people smile, laugh and generally feel happiness is something that I enjoy. That being said, my art very much expresses the mood I was in when a piece was created; most of the time itâ€™s happy or content, but sometimes it is sad or agitated, it really depends on my mood. My inspiration for art comes from life, nature, my imagination and dreams. I love to paint movement and interesting shapes and horses and female figures are my favorite because they both have lots of curves! My family has had a huge impact on my art, as I have always received support and encouragement from them.</p>

                <h3>Artists Who Inspire Me</h3>
                <p>Famous artists who have inspired me are Van Gogh, Picasso, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Salvador Dali, Peter Max and David Schluss. They all use bright colors and express(ed) their ideas in creative ways which I have always found inspirational. For me, art is the ability to express yourself and not limit yourself to what is real; if it is in your mind, all it takes is putting paint to canvas and just let it flow.</p>
